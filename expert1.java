### Black-Box Testing
Black-box testing involves examining the functionality of an application without peering into its internal structures or workings. The tester is aware of what the software is supposed to do, but not how it achieves those functions. The primary focus is on input and output.

#### Functional Testing
Functional testing verifies that the software functions as expected and meets the specified requirements. It is concerned with what the system does.

##### Unit Testing
Unit testing is the process of testing individual components or pieces of code, typically functions or methods, to ensure they work as intended. Each unit is tested in isolation from other units.

##### Integration Testing
Integration testing combines individual units and tests them as a group. The goal is to identify issues that occur when units interact, such as interface mismatches or data flow problems.

##### System Testing
System testing involves testing the complete and integrated software system to verify that it meets all specified requirements. It evaluates the system's overall functionality and performance.

Alpha testing is performed by internal employees at the developerâ€™s site. It is an early testing phase aimed at identifying bugs before releasing the software to external users.

###### Beta Testing
Beta testing is conducted by real users in a real-world environment. This phase helps uncover issues that were not found during alpha testing and provides feedback on the product's usability and functionality.

##### Regression Testing
Regression testing ensures that recent code changes have not adversely affected existing functionality. It involves re-running previously executed tests to confirm that the software still works correctly.

##### Smoke Testing
Smoke testing is a preliminary testing process to check the basic functionality of an application. It acts as a quick check to ensure the major features of the software are working as expected.

##### Sanity Testing
Sanity testing is a narrow regression test that focuses on verifying specific functionalities after minor changes or bug fixes. It ensures that the changes have not introduced new defects.

##### Interface Testing
Interface testing evaluates the interaction between different modules or services. It ensures that data is correctly passed between components and that they work together as intended.

##### End-to-End Testing
End-to-end testing examines the entire application workflow from start to finish. It validates that the integrated system functions correctly and meets business requirements.

#### Non-Functional Testing
Non-functional testing focuses on attributes such as performance, usability, reliability, and other quality attributes that are not related to specific behaviors or functions.

##### Performance Testing
Performance testing measures how the system performs under various conditions, including its responsiveness and stability. It helps identify performance bottlenecks.

###### Load Testing
Load testing assesses how the system behaves under expected load conditions. It determines the system's capacity to handle user traffic and data processing.

Stress testing evaluates the system's robustness by subjecting it to extreme load conditions, beyond normal operational capacity. It helps determine the system's breaking point and stability under stress.

###### Soak Testing
Soak testing, also known as endurance testing, assesses the system's performance over an extended period. It ensures the system can handle prolonged usage without performance degradation or failure.

##### Usability Testing
Usability testing evaluates how user-friendly and intuitive the software is. It involves observing real users as they interact with the system to identify usability issues and areas for improvement.

##### Security Testing
Security testing identifies vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the software that could be exploited by attackers. It ensures that the software is protected against threats and unauthorized access.

##### Compatibility Testing
Compatibility testing verifies that the software works correctly across different environments, including various operating systems, browsers, and devices. It ensures consistent behavior and performance.

##### Compliance Testing
Compliance testing ensures that the software adheres to relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards. It is crucial for software in regulated industries such as healthcare and finance.

##### Reliability Testing
Reliability testing evaluates the software's ability to function correctly under specific conditions for a specified period. It ensures the software can operate without failure.

##### Maintainability Testing
Maintainability testing assesses how easily the software can be modified to fix defects, improve performance, or adapt to a changed environment. It is important for long-term software maintenance.

##### Portability Testing
Portability testing determines how easily the software can be transferred from one environment to another. It ensures that the software can operate in different platforms and configurations.

##### Accessibility Testing
Accessibility testing ensures that the software is usable by people with disabilities, including those with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments. It checks for compliance with accessibility standards.

#### Black-Box Testing Tools
Tools used in black-box testing help automate and streamline the testing process for both functional and non-functional aspects.

##### Selenium
Selenium is an open-source tool for automating web browsers. It is widely used for functional and regression testing of web applications.

##### QTP/UFT
QuickTest Professional (QTP), now known as Unified Functional Testing (UFT), is a commercial tool for automated functional and regression testing. It supports a wide range of applications and technologies.

##### LoadRunner
LoadRunner is a performance testing tool used to test applications under load. It helps identify performance issues by simulating multiple users and measuring system performance.

##### JMeter
Apache JMeter is an open-source tool for performance and load testing. It is used to test the performance of web applications, databases, and other services.

### White-Box Testing
White-box testing involves testing the internal structures or workings of an application. Testers need knowledge of the code, architecture, and internal logic of the software.

#### Unit Testing
Unit testing in white-box testing involves examining individual components of the software to ensure they perform as expected. This type of testing often requires code knowledge to design test cases.

#### Integration Testing
Integration testing in white-box testing combines individual units and tests them as a group. It focuses on the interactions and data flow between units, ensuring that they work together correctly.

#### System Testing
System testing in white-box testing assesses the entire system's functionality and performance. It involves examining the integrated application in a controlled environment to ensure it meets requirements.

#### Code Coverage Analysis
Code coverage analysis measures the extent to which the source code is tested. It helps identify untested parts of the codebase, ensuring comprehensive testing.

#### Path Testing
Path testing involves examining all possible paths through the code to ensure that every potential execution route is tested. It helps identify logic errors and untested scenarios.

#### Loop Testing
Loop testing focuses on the loops in the code, ensuring they function correctly. It involves testing different loop conditions, including zero iterations, one iteration, and multiple iterations.

#### Mutation Testing
Mutation testing evaluates the effectiveness of the test cases by introducing small changes (mutations) to the code. It checks if the existing tests can detect these changes, ensuring robust test coverage.

#### Security Testing
Security testing in white-box testing involves examining the code for security vulnerabilities and ensuring that security controls are implemented correctly. It requires an understanding of potential security threats and code analysis.

#### White-Box Testing Tools
